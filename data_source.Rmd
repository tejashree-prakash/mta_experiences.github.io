## About Our Data

Our analysis is based on NYC Open Data’s [NYC Open Data’s 2019 Subway Rider Survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/2019-Subway-Rider-Survey/4y8i-pbvd)
, a public dataset that captures how New Yorkers feel about subway service, delays, affordability, and overall satisfaction.


In addition to the survey data, we incorporate:

- **Official subway line colors** from NYC Open Data’s MTA colors dataset (2025) to match line families to their familiar hex color codes in our tables and visualizations.
- **Subway route geometry** from the NYU Spatial Data Repository (2016 NYC Subway Routes) to recreate an interactive subway map for exploring composite scores and rankings by line family.
