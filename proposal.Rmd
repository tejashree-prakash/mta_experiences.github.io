### Motivation: Provide an overview of the project goals and motivation.

New York City has a well-known public transportation system, used by thousands every day. Unfortunately, not all trains are created equal. As regular subway riders, we are consistently disappointed with our commuting experience and wonder if other riders feel the same way. Recent adjustments to payment systems, track and station closures, as well as inconsistent travel times, prompted us to explore the idea of rider satisfaction and question the efficacy of the MTA. The MTA has announced that there is potential for a fare increase. With wavering opinions on the efficiency of the train lines, is this increase justified? 
Using rider responses from the NYC Open Data 2019 Subway Rider Survey, we can evaluate the public opinion’s perception of the reliability of NYC’s MTA system. The goal of this project is to uncover patterns in satisfaction, identify factors that influence rider experience, and determine how delays, affordability, and service quality vary among subway lines. Using these ideas, we hope to identify which subway could be the gold standard in daily transportation satisfaction.

### Related work: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a website, or something we discussed in class.

When exploring examples of final projects from previous years, the intricacy and quality of the graphs and variables allowed us to visualize a detailed outcome for our research. These projects made it clear that we needed a dataset robust enough to support multiple types of graphs and exploratory questions. Particularly, the projects “Squirrels in Central Park,” “Emma’s Marathon Training,” and “Operation Lorax” inspired us to look into a topic that could be represented as a visual map distribution of  New York City. Our deep dive into NYC Open Data sparked investigative ideas, which led us to the Subway Rider Experience Survey. This 2019 survey stood out because it contained many variables per respondent and other measures that could be meaningfully visualized. Lastly, we created a fun and competitive theme for the website using our subway line ranking initiative. May the best track win!
